# Next.js Build Error: Missing 'pages' directory

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Next.js applications: the missing or misplaced `pages` directory.  While you can create custom API routes and use other features, Next.js fundamentally relies on the `pages` directory to bootstrap. If it's missing, the application will fail to build.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file illustrates a simple Next.js page. However, if the `pages` directory is not correctly structured within the project, building the application will result in an error. This is because Next.js uses the pages directory to determine the structure and routing of your application.  Even if the app isn't using the pages directory directly (for example if only using API routes), it's still required to be present. 

## The Solution

The solution, shown in `bugSolution.js` is to ensure that the `pages` directory exists within the `src` directory (or the root if you're not using src) of your project. Create the directory if it's missing. The presence of the `pages` directory, regardless of its contents, will satisfy the Next.js build process.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Attempt to build the application without adding a `pages` directory.  You'll receive a build error. 
3.  Create an empty `pages` directory in the root (or `src`) of the project.
4.  Rebuild the application. The build should now succeed.
